      <p>If this movie was made in the 90s, it would’ve been called William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, and we probably would’ve been the worse for it. This was amazing. The rating is gonna skyrocket when the Rome-heads find this. I’m still trying to formulate my thoughts, but I loved this, mess and all. The extended romantic interlude was spectacular, and the spectacle did not disappoint. Bye Megalopolis!</p>
